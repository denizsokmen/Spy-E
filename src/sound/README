2015-04-06 04:59:03 : AU sound format support added.
2015-04-06 03:57:03 : Listener/Source positioning and velocity added.
2015-03-30 15:59:42 : Checking WAVE Riff added.
2015-03-23 13:18:21 : Defining and playing a sound by name added.
2015-03-23 10:37:07 : STD vector is used to keep sound information.
2015-03-21 15:09:28 : Stop, Loop and file check added.
2015-03-18 18:48:58 : Load Wav file added.

Usage : 

SoundManager sound_manager;        
          
ALuint sound = sound_manager.open("sound.wav"); // <AL/al.h>
sound_manager.play(sound);

or

ALuint sound = sound_manager.open("sound","sound.wav");
sound_manager.play("sound");

TODO:

- May decode ogg to raw sound data(VORBIS includes needed)
- Big endian order must be covered for WAV/raw sound files.
- More error checks
- Standalone sound class
- Deleting sound data directly
- AU support need to be reimplemented(Data in incorrect order)
- Recognize AU audio format as OpenAL declaration
- Use of OpenAL effects(EFX extension)

Done

- Safer structure to keep buffer IDs(x)
- Checking file if its WAVE RIFF
- Changing char arrays to STD strings
- Source and Listener Positioning
- May extend to cover AU and ADPCM(AU)
