TODO:

- May extend to cover AU and ADPCM
- May decode ogg to raw sound data
- More error checks
- Source and Listener Positioning
- Standalone sound class
- Direct data erasure
- Checking file if its WAVE RIFF
- Changing char arrays to STD strings
- Making GCC shut up

Done
- Safer structure to keep buffer IDs(x)
