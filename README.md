## Spy-E  
  
Spy-E is a 3D stealth game project, which is based on **OpenGL 3.3™** and **C++**. 

### Description

The player is expected to use **stealth techniques** to avoid enemies, surveillance systems or solve puzzles and finally finish the mission in a virtual reality environment. There are many small-sized levels, each has a specific mission. After finishing the core game we are planning to add a user-friendly level editor for the users to make custom missions and create their own levels for the game. 

### External Libraries

All of the open source external libraries are in externals folder and [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net), [GLFW3](http://www.glfw.org), [GLM](http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.6/index.html) are used for wrapping newer OpenGL versions, getting rid of platform dependent window creation and efficient math library for vector and matrix arithmetic. We are also using [CMake](http://www.cmake.org) for cross-platform makefiles to compile C++ code. 


### Platforms Supported

* Windows XP and later, 
* GNU/Linux, 
* Mac OS X 10.9+
* A graphics driver and card that support **OpenGL 3.3™**.
